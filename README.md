# cfg-web-dev-project
ðŸŒŸ As part of the Code First Girls web development kickstarter, I worked in a team to build a concept website for a Castle in Scotland. Here you'll find my code for the Home and About page with the screenshots. Our website was chosen as the winning project for the course. Screenshots in the link provided.

During the 8-week course we were introduced to:

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- UX/UI design
- Github
- Javascript

The project brief included:

- Creating Figma wireframes
- A minimum of 2 HTML pages and an external CSS file
- All links working
- User interaction (Hover, action on click)
- Mobile responsiveness
- Effective use of classes and IDs

My contribution includes Home page and About page elements + Navigation for our group's chosen theme.
